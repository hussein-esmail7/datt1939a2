	<h1>Robbery: Statement.html</h1>
    <p><b>1. Title for our A2</b></p>
    <p>
        Robbery
    </p>

    <p><b>2. A clear list of all the choices you made for Columns 1 - 4, above.</b></p>
	<p>
		Please see our submitted report <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQ-Ull1vDqeIVDecul5Q5r4slwQJ-MVs0nRILzLU88U/edit?usp=sharing">here on Google Docs</a>.

    <p><b>3. Articulate your concepts and intentions in a brief explanation of, guiding questions for, and/or artist's statement about your completed work.
        Minimum Articulation word count: 300 words / Suggested Maximum: 700 words</b></p>
	<p>
		<!-- TODO -->
	</p>

    <p><b>4. List ALL the filenames of web pages that contribute to fulfilling the JavaScript requirements:</b></p>
    <p><b>&nbsp; 4a. List file names of the pages that add to the total count of pages using JavaScript (of any and all kinds).</b></p>
	<p>
		<!-- TODO -->
	</p>

    <p><b>&nbsp; 4b. Separately, list the file names of page(s) demonstrating the different A2 JavaScript Categories used in your A2. (Yes, that means the names in this list will also be in the previous list, above).</b></p>
    <p>
		<!-- TODO -->
	</p>

    <p><b>5. Include a sitemap diagram - showing all the HTML files/windows in your A2 and how they lead to each other. Differentiate between normal links between pages and links controlled by JavaScript (ie. label or colour code the links controlled by JavaScript).</b></p>

    <br>

    <p><b>(A sitemap is an image similar in some ways to the diagrams towards the bottom of the Structure in an <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/nmw/datt1939f21/week05/interactivestructures.html">Interactive Space: Screen to Screen / Document to Document</a> page, except the sitemap should label each page with its filename, and use different-coloured arrows to show normal links versus JS links.)</b></p>
    <p>
		<!-- TODO -->
	</p>

    <p><b>6. Give credit for any outside sources you used (if any) to learn JavaScript, or for outside JS examples that you adapted -whether from books, websites (link to specific pages/examples), etc.</b></p>

    <p><b>7. Give credit/list sources for any Creative Commons Licensed media you use on or in creating the A2 (if you use any).</b></p>

    <br>

    <p><b>Bibliographic-level citations are not required, but you must give appropriate credit for any and all non-original text, images, sound, or JavaScript (except for examples from the DATT 1939 Resource page) used in the A2.</b></p>

    <br>

    <p><b>Include notable pieces of information, for example, for media found on the web include the URL, name of the site it was found on, creator if known, and any other important information. Use your judgement, and give credit where it is due.</b></p>
